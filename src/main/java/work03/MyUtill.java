          named "weight" and "height" and it returns a "double" 
          which is the result of "weight" divided by "height"^2.
      3.3 Create a method named "average" in "MyUtil" class.
          This method receives three parameters of type "int" named
          "v1", "v2", "v3" and it returns a "double" which is 
          the average values of the three parameters.
